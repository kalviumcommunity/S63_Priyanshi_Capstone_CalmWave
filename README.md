### A Personalized Sound Therapy App for Mental Wellness

## 🧠 Project Idea
**CalmWave** is a sound therapy web app designed to help users manage stress, anxiety, and mood through calming soundscapes, personalized therapy sessions, and mood tracking.

Users take a simple quiz to assess their mental state, after which the app provides sound therapy sessions based on the user's anxiety level. Users can also track their daily mood and view their progress over time with visual insights.
